# Solidity Learning Repository

This repository documents my progress learning **Solidity** and smart contract development.  
Each folder corresponds to a topic or day of study, containing `.sol` contracts and concise notes.

---

## Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| [day01_simple_storage](day01_simple_storage/) | Basic Solidity syntax, variables, functions, structs, arrays |
| [day02_data_locations](day02_data_locations/) | Memory vs Calldata vs Storage – how Solidity handles data in the EVM |

More sections will be added as learning continues (mappings, modifiers, inheritance, Hardhat, etc).

---

## Tools

- **Solidity** `^0.8.x`
- **Remix IDE** – for compiling and testing contracts quickly
- **Hardhat** – for local development (coming soon)
- **Ethers.js** – for interaction examples (future)
- **OpenZeppelin** – for contract templates and security patterns

---

## Notes

- Each folder contains a `notes.md` summarizing what was learned.
- Contracts are written for clarity and explanation, not production use.
- This repo is primarily for education and experimentation.
